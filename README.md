# AIML Practice

Welcome to my **AIML Practice** repository!

This repository serves as a centralized log of my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Here, you will find algorithms, practice exercises, and projects that I build as I master new concepts.

> **⚠️ Note:** This repository is a **work in progress**. I update it progressively as I learn each new topic. Some sections may be incomplete or subject to change as I refine my understanding and skills.

## 📂 What's Inside

* **Algorithms:** Implementation of ML algorithms from scratch and using libraries.
* **Projects:** Practical applications and mini-projects.
* **Study Materials:** Notes, datasets, and resources I use for learning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders to see how different algorithms are implemented. Since I am actively learning, code structure and efficiency will improve over time!

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/waqarwasif/AIML_Practice.git](https://github.com/waqarwasif/AIML_Practice.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to a topic folder to view the code or notebooks.
